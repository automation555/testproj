Just doing 
   git commit

does not seem to automagically commit all fiels that have changed.

I had to do 

 git comit README 

once I altered the file; otherwise, git gave me some "nothing has changed" message


Likewiese with 

    git add


It does not add all new files.


I created NOTES.txt and ran git add, and it told me:

   Nothing specified, nothing added.
   Maybe you wanted to say 'git add .'?
